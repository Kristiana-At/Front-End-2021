                Lizzie is distraught with the loss of her newborn daughter Rosie, who died in a hospital fire along with 12 mothers and babies. 7 years later she's desperately trying to process the steps of grieving and raise her son, Thomas, who she has shared custody of with her ex, Mike. At a birthday party for her son’s friend, she sees a little girl whom she immediately believes to be Rosie. She befriends the girl’s parents, Claire and Bernard, by faking interest in their for-sale house. Their sons become friends and she learns the girl's name is Lola.            </p>
